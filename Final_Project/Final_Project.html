            <DIV>
                For my Final Project, I decided to create a Piano Keyboard with Arduino, where I used push buttons as
                inpout and a buzzer as output. The push buttons are acting as different keys in the keyboard, and the
                buzzer produces the sound. The way that Arduino generates tones using Arduino is to use the tone()
                function, from the "pitches.h" Library. The "pitches.h" Library contains all the pitch values for typ-
                ical piano note, which allows the buzzer to produce different tones like a piano.

                <b>To build the circuit, I used:</b>
            </>
            <P ALIGN=LEFT>
                Arduino UNO<br>
                Push Buttons x 8<br>
                A Buzzer<br>
                Several Jumper Wires<br>

                Breadboard or PCB boards(soldered together)<br>
                <br>
                In order to make a keyboard, I soldered each push button to a PCB board and use<br>
                hook-up wires to connect them together. These materials are what I used to build<br>
                the final prototype. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Optional:</b><br>
                Solder(for soldering)<br>
                Soldering Iron(for soldering)<br>
                Hook-up Wires(for soldering)<br>
                Glue Gun(to glue the PCB boards together and secure the circuit)<br>
                Acrylic Plexiglass Sheet(for laser cutting)<br>
                <br>
                <DIV>
            <b>Building the circuit: </b><br>
                 First, connect the Buzzer i.e. its positive terminal to Pin 13 of Arduino. It is necessary to connect the Buzzer to one of the PWM capable pins of Arduino. The other end of the Buzzer is connected to GND.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, connect 7 Push Buttons to digital input/ouput pins 2 through 8 of Arduino. These pins act as the tone input pins. I have used the INTERNAL PULL UP(syntax: pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP);)feature of Arduino
            and hence I haven’t connected any external pull-up resistors to these pins.
            <br>
            <br>
            All the other terminals of these push buttons are connected to GND.

            This is a simpler version of the schematic in which there are two types of schematics: the button schematic and the the buzzer schematic.
                The entire schematic is built by 8 buttons and a buzzer.

<DIV>The code for the project How to make Arduino based Piano is given below. The code
                                below uses an extra file, pitches.h. This file contains all the pitch values for typical
                                notes. For example, NOTE_C4 is middle C. NOTE_FS4 is F sharp, and so forth. This note
                                table was originally written by Brett Hagman, on whose work the tone() command was based.

<DIV>To make the prototype looks and acts more like a piano board, I soldered the buttons, buzzer and wires on 8 PCB boards.(Each PCB boards has a button or a buzzer on it) Then, I used glue gun to secure all components on the PCB board. To make each key “pressable”, I glued another PCB board on top of each PCB board to make a complete key. Finally, I used laser cutter to make the base board, and use glue gun to glue all the PCB boards on the acrylic base board.
